# SLOPE

## Part of codes of our work, (k/f-) SLOPE published in  AAAI'2023.

# 1. Environment
-------------

**Python 3.9**

**Numpy**

**scipy**

**random**


# 2. Compiling
------------

In order to solve SLOPE, k-SLOPE and F-SLOPE, it is necessary to compile slope.py first. And then run other Python version files.

For the stepdown procedure, just run multiple_stepdown_F.py or multiple_stepdown_k.py directly.
